  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of its input. In computer science, we analyze the efficiency of algorithms by considering their time complexity. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in the time it takes to execute.
  </p>

  <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
  <p>
    Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis, measuring the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to its input size. One common notation used to express space complexity is O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> provides insights into how well an algorithm utilizes memory resources during its execution.
